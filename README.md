### **Notes (please read!)**

🇬🇧
A pre-created user is available for demo purposes. The "Demo Data" button uploads dummy booking data to the database, which will be fetched by the dashboard after it's reloaded.

**Important**: While this is just a sample project built for learning purposes, I humbly ask that you don't intentionally misuse any data deletion/edition functionalities, as not to mess up the database. 🙏

🇧🇷
Usuário de teste já disponível para fins de demonstração. O botão "Demo Data" faz upload de dados mockados para a database, os quais serão atualizados na dashboard após um refresh ou troca de página.

**Importante**: Apesar deste projeto ser apenas para fins de aprendizado, peço humildemente que não faça mal uso intencional das funcionalidades de edição/exclusão de dados, pois ambos se refletem na database automaticamente. 🙏
